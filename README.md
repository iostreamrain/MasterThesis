naist-thesis-tmpl-en
===============================

A modern LaTeX template for your doctoral dissertation or master's thesis of NAIST Graduate School of Information Science.

(Japanese version is [here](https://github.com/kmiya/naist-thesis-tmpl))

## Features
The template:

- consists of some `.tex` files instead of a `.sty` file for the sake of usability and customizability.
- uses the [KOMA-Script](http://texcatalogue.ctan.org/entries/koma-script.html) bundle which provides replacements for the article, report, and book classes with emphasis on typography and versatility.
- uses `hyperref.sty` which produces hypertext links in the document.

## Usage

    $ git clone git@github.com:kmiya/naist-thesis-tmpl-en.git

or [click this link](https://github.com/kmiya/naist-thesis-tmpl-en/archive/master.zip) to download as zip.

- **major** (`ENGINEERING` or `SCIENCE`)
- **title** of the thesis

## FAQ

#### ``Contents'' should contain itself
Change the following line of `setting.tex`

```tex
\usepackage[nottoc]{tocbibind}
```

to

```tex
\usepackage{tocbibind}
```

Notice that the change might break the layout of ``Contents'' on a certain LaTeX environment
(thanks to @matcha-shake for reporting this issue).
