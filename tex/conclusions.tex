WPT uses the electric power to electromagnetic field to electric power transmission mode to realize the transmission without electrical contact, and provides a safe and reliable power transmission scheme for underwater sensors and electromechanical equipments. 
However, under the seawater environment, the electromagnetic coupler has a low coupling coefficient, additional circuit and dielectric loss, and a series of problems such as low transmission efficiency of WPT, which hinder the general application of this technology in the field of marine technology. 
In this thesis, the electromagnetic radiation, coil offset and transmission efficiency of the non-contact power transmission system in the marine environment are studied on the basis of the preliminary research of the research group. Discussing how to obtain high transmission efficiency and maintain low electromagnetic radiation from multiple perspectives such as system mechanism, simulation calculation, parameter design, coil design, system implementation and experimental testing, has certain academic value and practical significance.

From the perspective of practical application, with full consideration of marine environmental factors, a more detailed and in-depth theoretical study and analysis of the transmission efficiency under different resonance compensation structures and load resistance values are carried out, and the research results are summarized as follows:

% 以的空气中WPT模型为基碰，提出海水环境下的线圈的等效模型。
% 通过空气中与水中WPT模型比较，表明海水介质改变了原系统中某些参数的数值，但并未改变空气下系统的无线能量传输原理。
% 因此，海水环境下的基本分析方法是：在常规空气WPT模型分析的基础上，结合海水介质对WPT系统内参数的综合影响分析，来指导海水环境下的WPT系统设计。
Based on the WPT model in the air, an equivalent model of the coil in the seawater environment is proposed.
The comparison between the WPT model in the air and the water shows that the seawater medium changes the values of some parameters in the original system, but does not change the wireless energy transmission principle of the system in the air.
Therefore, the basic analysis method in seawater environment is: on the basis of analysis of conventional WPT model in the air, combined with the analysis of the comprehensive influence of seawater media on the parameters of the WPT system, to guide the design of WPT system under seawater.

\section{Future works}
Due to the limitation of time and conditions, the research and work of this article have further in-depth and perfect places:

Because of the difficulty of the simulation and the lack of suitable experimental components, this research has not yet optimized the mini-coils in the coil-array. If we can do more research on the size, size, and shape of these coils, we could get better system performance.

Because it is difficult to analyze the mutual inductance between multiple sets of connected coils in a three-dimensional space, we have not yet analyzed the influence between mini-coils, which leads us to not know the optimal mini-coils layout.
